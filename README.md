# Predictive Maintenance: A Comparative Analysis of Data Sampling Techniques

This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis project, which focuses on enhancing machine failure prediction by addressing the challenge of imbalanced data. I explored and compared several data sampling techniques to determine their effectiveness in improving classification model performance.

The core of this work is a comparison between traditional methods like SMOTE and random undersampling against a more advanced Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approach for creating synthetic minority class data.

## üìù Project Objective

In industrial settings, machine failures are rare events. This leads to highly imbalanced datasets where the "failure" class is severely underrepresented. When trained on such data, machine learning models often become biased towards the majority class (non-failure) and perform poorly at predicting actual failures‚Äîthe very events we want to prevent.

The goal of this project was to:
1.  Implement and evaluate different sampling methods to rebalance the dataset.
2.  Compare the performance of two classification models (**Random Forest** and **SVM**) trained on these rebalanced datasets.
3.  Assess the viability of using a GAN (specifically a **WPGAN-GP** via the TabGAN library) to generate high-quality synthetic data for the minority class.

## üìä The Dataset

This project uses the **AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset** (with a small change in the feature columns). It's a synthetic dataset that simulates real-world predictive maintenance scenarios and was created for this purpose.

-   **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset)
-   **Reference Paper:** [Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Predictive Maintenance Applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9268676) by Matzka, S.

The dataset contains 10,000 data points with features like air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. The target is to predict two types of failures: **Machine Failure** (a general flag) and specific failure modes. My analysis focuses on the binary classification of the `Machine Failure` target.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

To tackle the class imbalance, I implemented four distinct sampling strategies before training the classifiers.

1.  **Baseline (Stratified Sampling):** The original, imbalanced data was split into training and testing sets while preserving the original percentage of samples for each class. This serves as our baseline for comparison.
2.  **Random Undersampling:** This method balances the dataset by randomly removing samples from the majority class. It's simple, but risks discarding potentially useful information.
3.  **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):** A popular oversampling method that creates new minority class instances by interpolating between existing ones.
4.  **WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty):** A sophisticated deep learning approach. I used the `TabGAN` library to train a Generative Adversarial Network on the minority class data. The GAN learns the underlying data distribution and generates new, realistic synthetic data points representing machine failures.

These rebalanced training datasets were then used to train a **Random Forest Classifier** and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. Their performance was evaluated on a common, untouched test set. The Hyperparameters of the GAN where optimized with Optuna's TPESampler, with respect to the RF ROC AUC. A very simple/shallow RF parameter grid was used throughout this project to keep the run time as low as possible, given my hardware limitations.

## üìà Key Findings

My analysis demonstrated that WGAN-GP for minority class data augmentation can be a great re-sampling technique, provided that you do not treat it like a black box. 

During my first implementation, i used a Single-GAN architecture to oversample the minority class (the failures), meaning that the model tried to learn the distribution of all the failure types at once, missing critical information. 

When i switched the architecture to a Multi-GAN structure (one GAN per failure type == 4 GANs), then the AUC ROC score exceeded the baseline's (no re-sampling and class_weight='Balanced'), as the second model tried to learn the distribution of each failure type separately and managed to produce more realistic synthetic data.

The key takeaway is that a lot of attention should be payed to the math (or at least the logic) of each algorithm in order for informed decisions to be made.
